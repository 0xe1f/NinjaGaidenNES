# Ninja Gaiden — progress

## End goal

The entire ROM should live in the repo as source: every byte is labelled
`.asm`, and `make verify` matches `NinjaGaiden.sha1`. No committed binaries
in the final state.

File banks stay separate. MMC1 maps one 16 KiB bank at `$8000` and keeps
bank 07 at `$C000`, so each switched bank can be its own file.

## Done

- Toolchain: ca65/ld65, cc65 V2.19 (`make tools`).
- Scaffold: `NinjaGaiden.asm` stitches the iNES header and 8 PRG + 16 CHR
  file banks. `make verify` matches the US dump.
- PRG bank 07 (`prg/bank07.asm`) is the fixed `$C000` bank. Named: MMC1
  control `$1E`, the play-frame gate (`frame_gate`, `to_hold`,
  `area_event`, `lose_life`), `set_prg` / `set_chr0` / `set_chr1`,
  `wait_nmi`, `sprite0_split`, `read_joy`, NMI, and the IRQ `RTI`.
  `timer` is `$63`, `ninpo` is `$64`, `health` is `$65`, `area` is `$6D`,
  `lives` is `$76`. `player_control` (`$EB7B`) moves Ryu for the frame and
  picks his action from the pad.
  `set_action` (`$F62D`) starts that action. `actor_kind` (`$C195`) is one
  entry per enemy, each pointing at that enemy's actions (`$C1ED`–`$D5B2`).
  `pick_area` (`$C0E9`) is a hidden stage select the game never calls.
  `$D63A`–`$E346` is the rest of a play frame: boss death, Ryu's weapons,
  lanterns and their power-ups, and each enemy's turn. `scroll_stage`
  (`$F1AC`) scrolls the stage when Ryu is in the middle of the screen.
  The rest of the bank is source too: spawning enemies, moving Ryu when
  the stage stays put, `next_area`, drawing, the clock and status bar,
  and the kick and snare samples. No `INCBIN` left in bank 07.

## Next

- Disassemble a switched PRG bank. Banks 00–06 are still `INCBIN` in
  `NinjaGaiden.asm`. Bank 04 is the cutscenes `area_event` calls.
